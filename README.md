Hi! Welcome to my Full stack web development Portfolio. I am creating this as of October 17th, 2021 but I feel as if this will be updated and more advanced in the coming months and well more devolped in the coming years. I, Christian Diaz, am new to the developing scene and want to work my hardest to devlop new and improved web designs and refractor new code when neeeded. This repository is where all my best of best work will be placed and will be updated frequently throughout my months of schooling and even after as I pursue a job in the field as a coder for web development or maybe I might find inetrest in another type of development down the line. 
My Three Main Goals:
1. I want not only work on the portfolio to be great but the web page itself to be presentable to employers.
2. I want there to be my top five codes to be on my portfolio that present my strenghts and that show what is me on code.
3. I want this Portfolio and repository to help and encourage young developers like myself to strive for what they want and to never hesitate on action.

This is a screenshot of my portfolio, it does not look the best as of now with the four place holders. Those place holders will be changed throughout my journey as a full stack developer. This repository will be the orgin of my developer journey, so that I will be able to look back upon how much I have improved and how much I have changed.
